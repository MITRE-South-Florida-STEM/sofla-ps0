Please refer to the PDF file in the repository for details of the homework assignment. Ignore references to the due date and also installation/usage of Spyder and Anaconda. Instead please use the online integrated development environment (IDE), replit.com.

There are additional hints in the PDF as well. You are welcome to work with each other, but please commit your final solution's in the repository that is under your login name.

As with the previous Python assignment, a feedback PR (pull request) will be autogenerated to allow the instructors to interact with students. Please use this as an additional means to ask questions to the instructor. Remember, we are also monitoring discord so that is preferred and always available.
